  ### Difference between array list and linked list <br />
  
  
	Array list is faster for iteration compared to linked list
	Array list is slower for adding and removing of elements compared to linked list
	
 ### Difference between set and hashset <br />
  
  
	Set is interface and HashSet is class which implements Set.
	A TreeSet is a set where the elements are sorted (and thus ordered), a HashSet is a set where the elements are not sorted or ordered.
	HashSet is typically a lot faster than a TreeSet
