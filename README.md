  ### Difference between array list and linked list <br />
  
  
	Array list is faster for iteration compared to linked list
	Array list is slower for adding and removing of elements compared to linked list
	
 ### Difference between set and hashset <br />
  
  
	Set is interface and HashSet is class which implements Set.
	A TreeSet is a set where the elements are sorted (and thus ordered), a HashSet is a set where the elements are not sorted or ordered.
	HashSet is typically a lot faster than a TreeSet
### Difference between listand arraylist <br />
  
     List is an interface while ArrayList is a class
### Difference between LinkedHashSet and HashSet <br />
LinkedHashSet maintains the insertion order. When we iterate through a HashSet, the order is unpredictable

### Difference between LinkedHashMap and HashMap <br />
LinkedHashMap maintains insertion order of keys, order in which keys are inserted in to LinkedHashMap. On the other hand HashMap doesn't maintain any order or keys or values

## MapInterface

## HashMap vs HashTable vs HashSet

HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values whereas Hashtable doesnâ€™t allow any null key or value.
